This is first project made by Jack XIN in Becode

The aim of this project is to scraper leaders info for different defined countries from wikipedia.

cookies are important to scraper the data, so, we need to make sure that we have good cookies
in order to save time, we use cache to store scrapered data

we use virtual environment to make sure the project is running in controlled environment, and the  virtual environment is inside the project folder
